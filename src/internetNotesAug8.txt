distance vector protocol:

respoonse to failed router - 
	bad response - asking neighbors of routers that detect a failed router can lead to routing loops
	better response: neighbors initiate a route discover to disconnected destinations

IP fragmentation and reassembly
-different links have different mtu
-ID field generated by sender
-flags	-unused
	-df don't fragment
	-mf more fragments coming
-fragments duplicate

fragmentation example:
big ip packet 6k byte payload
does not fit through 1500 byte ethernet links
fragment packet into smaller packets
first packet fragment
20B header, 1480B payload
packet ID 8451, DF=0, MF=


Checksum
-test for data integrity
-checksum function: takes data of any form, any length, to produce a numeric value
look into checksum functions

dhcp

1. entering machine DHCP discovery broadcast
source 0.0.0.0 dest 255.255.255.255 port 67

2. DHCP server responds with dhcp offer packet broadcast on port 68 contains IP address & length of lease in seconds

3 entering machine broadcasts dhcp request packet

4 dhcp ack from dhcp server to entering machine
